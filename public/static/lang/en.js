Following a decentralized processing model will lead to higher costs, data silos, and complex operations and maintenance. Workload consolidation, on the other hand, means running more old and new workloads on fewer independent devices, thereby reducing the footprint and reducing the complexity of the system and environment. This approach to smart transportation can help transportation management reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) while cutting operational expenses (OpEx) by increasing efficiency, streamlining operations, and improving maintenance and end-of-life service support for equipment.'
